    "In Data Science and Data Engineering, the process of taking data from a source, changing it, and then loading it into a database is called ETL, which is short for extract, transform, load. ETL tends to be more programming-intensive than other data science tasks like visualization, so we'll also spend time in this lesson exploring Python as an object-oriented programming language. Specifically, we'll create our own Python class to contain our ETL processes."
